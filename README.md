* _2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "ProjectFile"._
* _3. In the command line, run the command `\$ dotnet run` to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal._
